The first bonus feature for Web Monetization users is live: a theme selector.

Currently, the site allows you to select switch between light and dark mode, but what if you fancy something a little bit different? Well, we now have a few more themes available for Web Monetization users: a peach one and two black-and-white themes (light and dark).

To activate the theme selector, you just need to have Web Monetization enabled, e.g. by having a [Coil membership](https://coil.com/) and getting either a Coil browser extension or the Puma Browser.
