## Do you want to know more about Web Monetization and monetizing content?

_**And also understand Portuguese?**_

Then have we got a session for you!

Interruptor's **Rute Correia e Ciaran Edwards** will give a small presentation on the basics of Web Monetization, how they implemented it, and some of the issues they faced along the way.

We'll also have special guest **Patrick Rahy, founder of [Kult](https://kult.pt/)**, a social network focused on sharing culture. Like Interruptor, Kult was awarded a grant by Grant For The Web in June 2021 to add Web Monetization to their platform.

Patrick will share their experience so far, in **"Kult e a monetização da curadoria humana com Web Monetization"** (Kult and the monetization of human curation with Web Monetization).

The session will be streamed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7CE-znQHi8g099n2arVj6A) on Tuesday 8th February at 18:30 (Europe/Lisbon timezone), so come along!
