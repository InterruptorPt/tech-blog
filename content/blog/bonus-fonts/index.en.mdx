Our second bonus feature for Web Monetization users is now available: a font selector. We picked a few extra fonts for you to choose from, so have a look and see if there's anything that's more to your liking.

To activate the settings menu where you'll find the font and theme selectors, you just need to have Web Monetization enabled, e.g. by having a [Coil membership](https://coil.com/) and getting either a Coil browser extension or the Puma Browser.
