## Welcome to Interruptor's tech blog!

While the main site is about culture, data science _and_ technology, there are some things we'd like to share that are a bit too technical to post there. That's why we've set up this blog, where we'll discuss things like how we build features on the site, open-source technology, and the research that goes into making the articles.

Recently, we were awarded a grant from [Grant for the Web](https://grantfortheweb.org) to look into "Web Monetization", which would allow our readers to support us without them needing to set up subscriptions and without us needing to resort invasive ads. We'll have a series of posts here related to what we learn along the way, how others can implement it, and any open-source tech that we release to help people get started with it too.

We hope you find whatever we write about here interesting and useful, and if you ever want to get in touch with us, you can find some ways to contact us in the footer below. See you soon!
