We've released the code from ["Web Monetization: Part 2 - Checking it's active"](/en/blog/web-monetization-part-two-checking-its-active) as a [package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@interruptor/react-monetization). The package currently gives you two things:

- the `WebMonetizationProvider` for setting up the event listeners needed for tracking web monetization events

```jsx
const MyApp = ({ children }) => {
  return <WebMonetizationProvider>{children}</WebMonetizationProvider>
}
```

- the `useWebMonetization` hook for reading the web monetization state in your components.

```jsx
const {
  isActive,
  state, // either "pending", "started" or "stopped"
} = useWebMonetization()
```

If you want to check it out, you can find the [package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@interruptor/react-monetization) and the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/InterruptorPt/react-monetization).
